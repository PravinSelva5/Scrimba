Developed a Simple Snake Game through Scrimba's Frontend Developer Path.

In the Snake Game:

- User has the ability to Start and Restart the Game
- Apple randomly changes to a different location on the grid once the snake eats it
- Every time the snake eats an apple, it'll get bigger and will start moving faster.
